<!-- Intent for this application is to utilize a single HTML file for all content (no extertnal links).
 Therefore, rather than have quiz questions, high scores, "Try Again", "Well Done", and "Landing Page"
be considered as pages, these will all be written as elements that are hidden/displayed based on user
interaction with the page-->
