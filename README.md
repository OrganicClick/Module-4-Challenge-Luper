ERRORS NOTICED THAT I CAN't FIX (YET): 
If you run through the quiz a second time, you'll notice that you won't be presented with the well-done page. 

The time-up-container in the JS is not finished and likely needs touch up in HTML.

Ran out of time to include localStorage and submission of user score and initials to high-score-container.
